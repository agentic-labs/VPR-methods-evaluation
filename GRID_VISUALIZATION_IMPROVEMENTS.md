# Grid Visualization Improvements

## Overview

The grid visualization system has been significantly improved to handle clusters and communities of any size, with adaptive layouts and sizing. These improvements apply to all clustering methods, with special emphasis on Leiden community detection.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **No Size Limitations**
- Removed all hardcoded size limits (previously limited to 10-20 images)
- All clusters/communities are now visualized regardless of size
- Applies to:
  - K-means clustering
  - HDBSCAN clustering
  - Hierarchical clustering
  - Connected components
  - Leiden community detection
  - Louvain community detection

### 2. **Adaptive Image Sizing**
The system now automatically adjusts image size based on the total number of images:

| Number of Images | Image Size | Grid Columns |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| ≤ 10            | 200px      | 5 max        |
| 11-25           | 150px      | 5            |
| 26-50           | 120px      | 8            |
| 51-100          | 100px      | 10           |
| > 100           | 80px       | 12           |

### 3. **Smart Grid Layout**
- Automatically calculates optimal grid dimensions
- Separate rows for database and query images in cluster visualizations
- Single grid for mixed images in component visualizations
- Maximum canvas size limits (3000x3000px) with automatic scaling for very large grids

### 4. **Enhanced Visual Features**
- **Color coding**: Blue borders for database images, red borders for queries
- **Adaptive borders**: Border width scales with image size
- **Labels**: "DB" and "Q" labels for smaller grids (≤50 images)
- **Legends**: Automatic legend for large grids (>50 images)
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing or corrupted images

### 5. **Improved Readability**
- Adaptive font sizes for titles and labels
- Proper spacing between images (scales with image size)
- Clear visual separation between database and query images
- Informative titles showing cluster/component ID and size breakdown

## Usage Examples

### For Leiden Community Detection
```bash
python main.py --perform_leiden --nn_graph_neighbors 3 --database_folder toy_dataset/database --queries_folder toy_dataset/queries
```

All communities at all resolution levels will now be visualized, regardless of size.

### For K-means Clustering
```bash
python main.py --perform_clustering --num_clusters 5 --database_folder toy_dataset/database --queries_folder toy_dataset/queries
```

All clusters will be visualized with appropriate grid layouts.

### Testing the Improvements
Run the test script to see examples of the improved visualizations:
```bash
python test_grid_visualization.py
```

This will create sample visualizations demonstrating:
- Small clusters (< 10 images)
- Medium clusters (10-25 images)
- Large clusters (> 25 images)
- Different component sizes

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions

1. **`create_cluster_visualization()`**
   - Changed `max_images` parameter default from 10 to `None`
   - Added adaptive sizing logic
   - Improved grid calculation
   - Better error handling

2. **`create_component_visualization()`**
   - Added multi-tier sizing system
   - Implemented canvas size limits with scaling
   - Added legend for large grids
   - Improved label visibility

3. **Clustering Method Updates**
   - Removed size checks in Leiden clustering
   - Removed size checks in Louvain clustering
   - Removed size checks in connected components
   - All methods now visualize all clusters/communities

### Performance Considerations

- Large grids (>100 images) are automatically scaled to fit within reasonable canvas dimensions
- Image loading is done with error handling to prevent crashes
- Memory usage scales linearly with cluster size
- Visualization quality is maintained through adaptive sizing

## Benefits

1. **Complete Analysis**: No clusters are hidden from visualization
2. **Scalability**: Handles both tiny and large clusters effectively
3. **Consistency**: Same visualization approach across all clustering methods
4. **Clarity**: Adaptive sizing ensures readability at any scale
5. **Flexibility**: Works with any dataset size

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Interactive visualizations for very large clusters
- Pagination for extremely large clusters
- Zoom capabilities for detailed inspection
- Export to multiple formats (PDF, SVG)
- Customizable color schemes
